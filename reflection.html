		<p>The concept of responsive web design is that page design and development should be responsive and adjusted according to user behavior and device environment (system platform, screen size, screen orientation, etc.).</p>

		<p>Responsive web design is used by professional web developers with flexible grids and layouts, as well as intelligent use of images and cascading style sheets (such as media queries and viewports). 
			By using various settings, web designers will set the style of attributes according to screen size, resolution, orientation, color function and other characteristics. 
			In other words, the page should be able to automatically respond to the user's device environment. 
			When a user switches from a laptop to a smartphone, the website should automatically change to accommodate content such as resolution, scripting capabilities, and image size. 
			Using responsive web design eliminates the need for different designs and developments for each new device and gadget on the market. 
			Therefore, a good responsive web design will take into account the various needs of mobile device users. 
			It should also respond to the user's various devices and settings. 
			Responsive web design is not about developing a separate design strategy for each new device, but saving time and money. 
			It eliminates the need for constant updates and revisions.
		</p>

		<p>Through my research, in Canada alone, more people access the Internet through mobile devices than desktop computers, so it's no wonder that responsiveness and mobile design skills are very important to employers. 
		   Responsive design means that the layout (sometimes features and content) of the website will change based on the screen size and device the user uses.
		   For example, when accessing a website from a desktop computer with a large display, users will get multiple columns, large graphics, and interactions created specifically for mouse and keyboard users. 
		   On mobile devices, the same website will appear as a single column optimized for touch interaction, but using the same basic file. Mobile design can include responsive design, but it also includes the creation of a separate mobile-specific design. 
		   Sometimes you want the experience that users get when they visit your website on a desktop computer to be completely different from the experience you want them to see when they visit from a smartphone. In this case, it makes sense for a mobile website to be completely different. 
		   For example, a banking website with online banking would benefit from a separate mobile website that allows users to view the nearest bank location and a simplified account view (because the mobile screen is smaller).</p>

		<p>In this course, I learned a lot about designing web pages through front-end web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
		   As a beginner, I learned that JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
		   HTML is used to provide the basic structure of a web page, and CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed. 
		   This course also enabled me to create a complete website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
		   At the end of this course, I successfully created a website that mainly uses Javascript and HTML mode. 
		   WEB222 class made me have a strong interest in web design, and I will continue to learn web design skills in the future.</p>
